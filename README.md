# Rtv1

##### 4th graphic project of 42 (group)

Your goal is to be able, using your program, to generate
computer generated images using the Ray-Tracing method.
These computer-generated images each represent a scene, seen from a specific position and angle, 
defined by simple geometric objects, and having a lighting system.

```
make 
./rtv1 maps/test
